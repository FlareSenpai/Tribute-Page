            <h2>WHAT IS GRASS JELLY?</h2>
            <p>Grass jelly comes in two varieties: black and green. Black grass jelly is made from the Mesona palustris plant, while the Cyclea barbata Miers plant is used to make green grass jelly. To make both varieties of glass jelly, the plants' leaves are soaked in water until a gel-like substance is formed.</p>
            <p>Once the gel forms, the jelly is often cut into cubes and served with milk tea or alongside fresh fruit, like mango, or sweetened red beans. Just like tea, the finished grass jelly contains phenolic compounds and phytochemicals like flavonoids and tannins (which are natural plant compounds) that provide several health benefits when you eat or drink them.</p>
